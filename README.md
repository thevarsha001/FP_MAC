 MAC is the basic building block of signal processing processor.Our initial accomplishment involved the implementation of a single precision Floating-Point Multiplier and Floating-Point Adder using Verilog within Xilinx Vivado. By seamlessly integrating these algorithms into the MAC framework, I successfully achieved our desired outcomes, showcasing expertise in signal processing, Verilog programming, and FPGA tools.
